      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h4>What are Round-Ups?</h4>
            <p>A "Round-Up" is the term we use to describe the spare change captured from automatically rounding up your transactions to the next dollar. For instance, if you bought a coffee for $2.43 on your connected credit/debit card, we would add 57 cents to your Round Up's page.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
             <h4>When will my 1st Round-Ups show up?</h4>
            <p>We receive updates from institutions approximately 4-6 times a day. Anytime a new transaction has been posted to your bank account, we will add the change to your Round-Up's page. Depending on your banking institution, multiple transactions may be posted to your bank account all at once. If this happens, we will take the sum of the change from each transaction and post it to your Round-Up's page.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h4>Does my change get donated immediately after every purchase?</h4>
            <p>Not exactly. To avoid high credit/debit processing fees, the change from your transactions is accumulated each month and then donated on the last day of the month. This ensures that as much of your Round-Up Donation as possible goes towards our cause instead of bank/credit card fees. It also allows you to set a "Monthly Limit" on how much you donated via Round-Ups so you can give comfortably.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h4>Why do you need my bank login information?</h4>
            <p>Round-Ups require you to log in and select the account (card) you want to connect. This authorizes us to receive transaction updates to determine your Round-Ups. During this step, you are interfacing directly with your financial institution. We DO NOT touch, receive or handle ANY of your login credentials. That information is encrypted by your institution and heavily protected using bank-level security protocol.</p>
